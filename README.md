<strong>"PIIQUANTE"</strong> is my 6th project at OpenCalssrooms Web-dev path.

![Alt Text](piiquant-pic.png)


Piiquante is a specialty maker of spicy, pepper-based condiments, asking for help with a new project. With the increasing popularity of specialty hot sauces, Piiquante wants to develop a hot sauce review web app called "Hot Takes."

The product manager at Piiquante eventually wants to transform the review app into an online store, she wants the first version to be a gallery that allows users to upload their favorite hot sauces and like/dislike ones that others share. The app’s front end has been developed using Angular and has been precompiled after internal testing, but Piiquante needs a back-end developer to build the API.

My task: create a secure API for backend.

Deploy the project locally:
Clone or download the code into your local machine

To run frontend-side:

cd frontend<br>
cd Web-Developer-P6<br>
npm install<br>
npm run start<br>
navigate to http://localhost:4200

To run the backend-server:

cd backend<br>
nodemon server
Add a subfolder in your backend folder and call it "images" 

To run the database(MongoDB):

create '.env' file in your backend folder containing the following:<br>
    //Mongo db connection:<br>
    MONGODB_URL="your url connection here"<br>
    //Secret token<br>
    SECRET_TOKEN="your token here"
